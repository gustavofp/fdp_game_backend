# Game Rooms

Personal project using Elixir and RethinkDB

The project is a service that you can create "game rooms" and join them

The service offer some sockets where you can listen to changes on game rooms

You can use the frontend on [this repository](https://github.com/gustavofp/game-rooms-frontend) to test the features

This was a project I made to learn Elixir and explore some language features, so there are a lot of improvements needed, but I think it can be useful for people learning Elixir or event to be a bootstrap project for a real game.
